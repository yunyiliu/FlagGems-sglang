"""moe_fused_mul_sum: out[t, h] = sum_k inputs[t, k, h] * w[t, k], fp32 accumulation.

w = topk_weights * routed_scaling_factor, zeroed for experts the routing masks
out.  There are two masking modes and they are mutually exclusive in the
reference: an `expert_map` lookup (`expert_map[topk_ids] >= 0`) takes priority,
otherwise `is_ep` masks on `topk_ids >= 0`.  Both are folded into the weight
before the accumulation, so the inner loop is a plain weighted sum.

Grid = (token, hidden tiles).  A program keeps a BLOCK_H fp32 accumulator and
walks the top_k slices, so the inputs tensor is read exactly once and written
once; the per-(t, k) weight is a scalar load hoisted out of the hidden tile.

Why it beats the reference: `inputs.float()` alone materialises a full fp32 copy
of a [T, K, H] tensor -- K times the size of the output -- and `* w.unsqueeze(-1)`
materialises another before `.sum(dim=1)` reads it again.

Portability: no tl.dot, no tl.math.*, no atomics, no int64 data.

# Enflame (and kunlunxin) are very sensitive to program COUNT: across our
# operators, per_token_quant_int8 at 4096 programs of 4096 elements scores 13.69x
# on Enflame while per_token_group_quant_int8 -- the same code with a smaller
# group -- launches 131072 tiny programs and scores 0.39x.  So the work is
# flattened to one linear index and walked with a grid-stride loop against a
# capped program count.  (That also sidesteps the grid.x <= 65535 / grid.y <= 255
# caps, since only one modest axis is ever launched.)
